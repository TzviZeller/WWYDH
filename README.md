# WWYDH - What Would You Do Here

---

This repository is a fork of the original project (https://github.com/1cph93/WWYDH) for the purpose of testing and oversite.

I oversaw this project for an in depended study at Towson University during the 2016 Fall Semester. This culminated in a research paper about the pitfalls of software engineering with respect to team dynamics in the realm of modern software engineering techniques.
